Here are projects I'm currently working on, but that are still unfinished as of yet.

## Programming

* A novel-writing app for web. Mostly building this because nothing else available suits what I want from novel-writing software.
* Open-source social media platform that is very bare-bones by default, but customizable. This one I'm working on for my partner's sake, as she has very strong opinions about the social media platforms she uses. Every feature that is not a basic, necessary feature should be opt-in (not opt-out), and a chronological feed should be the default.

## Writing

* **Quantum Immortality** is a science fiction novel I am currently drafting about an amnesiac stuck in a time loop, you can find more info on [my Tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/nixwithapen/738332935360479232/quantum-immortality-wip-intro?source=share) about the novel.
* **Heroic** is a young adult novel I am currently drafting about teenage superheroes, more information on it will be coming soon.
