Hello, and welcome to my new website (and blog)!

I'm Phoenix (he/they), a programmer and writer from Canada. I started setting up this website so I could put my portfolio and a blog on it.

This site is built on 11ty/Eleventy, a static site generator, and uses [Elva](https://github.com/scottsweb/elva) as the base, with some modifications. It's also multilingual, and currently has support for French, my second language, which I will do my best to translate most of my posts into. I plan to add support for Brazilian Portuguese (my third language) later as well.

I am by no means fluent in either French or Portuguese, mind you, but it's nice practice anyway, and I don't get very many opportunities to use either of them in my day to day life.

For the blog, I'll write about programming and web development, writing, and really whatever catches my interest. As I learn how to accomplish new things with programming, I'll make posts explaining my process.

Meanwhile, my portfolio will include both programming projects and my writing (poetry, short stories, etc.). If you're interested in my nonfiction writing, you can look through this blog or check out [my Medium page](https://medium.com/@nebulanix), where I post mainly about neurodivergence (autism, ADHD, etc.), mental health, LGBTQ+ issues, and more.

On the works-in-progress page, you can find information and updates about projects I'm currently working on that are still unfinished, including novels I'm writing.
